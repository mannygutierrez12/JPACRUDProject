# TVShow App

## Overview

### Problem:

I often struggle to remember the TV shows recommended to me by friends and family. Despite their great suggestions, I often forget about them, and the same happens when I try to recommend shows to others.

### Solution:

To address this issue, I have developed an easy-to-use application that allows me to share my favorite TV shows with my friends and family. They can view my list of favorite shows and also recommend potential shows for me to watch. The application incorporates a database to store information about the shows, including their names, categories, streaming platforms, show lengths, and number of seasons.

Users can also contribute to the database by adding shows they enjoy, and they can view my personal favorites as well.
